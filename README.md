# Using Python, Flask, MongoDB, HTML, and CSS to produce a website for Mars
This is a full-stack web application for which I:

* created a Python script employing splinter and BeautifulSoup to scrape current Mars news and high-resolution photos from NASA's JPL website, NASA's latest tweet about Mars from Twitter, and a table of facts about Mars from space-facts.com.
* created a MongoDB database to hold these photos and text
* employed Bootstrap to create a web page that displays the photos and text in a visually appealing way
* wrote a Flask app to pull data from MongoDB and display in an HTML page

Below is a screenshot of the webpage.
